HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.

These tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML, make your HTML easier to read, and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility. The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.

 the alt atribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

Link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements
a (anchor) elements can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.

To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.

Below is an example of an internal anchor link and its target element:

<a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
...
<h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>

When users click the Contacts link, they'll be taken to the section of the webpage with the Contacts header element.

Make Dead Links Using the Hash Symbol
Sometimes you want to add a elements to your website before you know where they will link.
You can just replace where the link would go with a hash value #

<!--
Create a Text Field
input elements are a convenient way to get input from your user.

You can create a text input like this:

<input type="text">

Note that input elements are self-closing.

Create an input element of type text below your lists.

-->

<!--
You can create placeholder text like so:

<input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">

-->

<!--
Create a Form Element
You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying an action on your form element.

<form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form>

Nest your text field inside a form element, and add the action="/submit-cat-photo" attribute to the form element.
-->

<!--
Add a Submit Button to a Form
Let's add a submit button to your form. Clicking this button will send the data from your form to the URL you specified with your form's action attribute.

Here's an example submit button:

<button type="submit">this button submits the form</button>

Add a button as the last element of your form element with a type of submit, and "Submit" as its text.

<!--
Basic HTML and HTML5: Use HTML5 to Require a Field
You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has filled them out.

For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the attribute required within your input element, like this: <input type="text" required>

-->

<!--
Create a Set of Radio Buttons
Multiple buttons but only one of them must be selected
<label> 
  <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>

It is considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element, with a value that matches the value of the id attribute of the input element. This allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between the label and the child input element. For example:

<label for="indoor"> 
  <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>
-->

<!--
Create a Set of Checkboxes
Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer.
Checkboxes are a type of input.

Each of your checkboxes can be nested within its own label element.
By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically associate the checkbox input with 
the label element surrounding it.

All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.

It is considered best practice to explicitly define the relationship between a checkbox input and its corresponding label by 
setting the for attribute on the label element to match the id attribute of the associated input element.

Here's an example of a checkbox:

<label for="loving"><input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>
-->

<!--
Use the value attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes

When a form gets submitted, the data is sent to the server and includes entries for the options selected.
Inputs of type radio and checkbox report their values from the value attribute.

For example:

<label for="indoor"> 
  <input id="indoor" value="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor 
</label>
<label for="outdoor"> 
  <input id="outdoor" value="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Outdoor 
</label>


Here, you have two radio inputs. When the user submits the form with the indoor option selected, 
the form data will include the line: indoor-outdoor=indoor. This is from the name and value attributes of the "indoor" input.

If you omit the value attribute, the submitted form data uses the default value, which is on. In this scenario,
if the user clicked the "indoor" option and submitted the form, the resulting form data would be indoor-outdoor=on,
which is not useful. So the value attribute needs to be set to something to identify the option.

-->

<!--
Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default
You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.

To do this, just add the word "checked" to the inside of an input element. For example:

<input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>

-->

<!--
Nest Many Elements within a Single div Element
The div element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose container for other elements.

The div element is probably the most commonly used HTML element of all.

Just like any other non-self-closing element, you can open a div element with <div> and close it on another line with </div>.

<!--
Declare the Doctype of an HTML Document
The challenges so far have covered specific HTML elements and their uses. 
However, there are a few elements that give overall structure to your page, and should be included in every HTML document.

At the top of your document, you need to tell the browser which version of HTML your page is using. 
HTML is an evolving language, and is updated regularly. Most major browsers support the latest specification, 
which is HTML5. However, older web pages may use previous versions of the language.

You tell the browser this information by adding the <!DOCTYPE ...> tag on the first line, where the ... part is the version of HTML. For HTML5, you use <!DOCTYPE html>.

The ! and uppercase DOCTYPE is important, especially for older browsers. The html is not case sensitive.

Next, the rest of your HTML code needs to be wrapped in html tags. 
The opening <html> goes directly below the <!DOCTYPE html> line, and the closing </html> goes at the end of the page.

Here's an example of the page structure:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <!-- Your HTML code goes here -->
</html>


<!--
Define the Head and Body of an HTML Document

You can add another level of organization in your HTML document within the html tags with the head and body elements.
Any markup with information about your page would go into the head tag. Then any markup with the content of the page 
(what displays for a user) would go into the body tag.

Metadata elements, such as link, meta, title, and style, typically go inside the head element.

Here's an example of a page's layout:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- metadata elements -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- page contents -->
  </body>
</html>
