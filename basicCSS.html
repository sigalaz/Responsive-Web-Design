<!--
Introduction to Basic CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML.

Note that CSS is case-sensitive so be careful with your capitalization.

CSS has been adopted by all major browsers and allows you to control:

color
fonts
positioning
spacing
sizing
decorations
transitions

There are three main ways to apply CSS styling. You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with the style attribute. 
Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within style tags in an HTML document. Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, 
then reference that file in the HTML document. Even though the first two options have their use cases, most developers prefer external style 
sheets because they keep the styles separate from the HTML elements. This improves the readability and reusability of your code.

The idea behind CSS is that you can use a selector to target an HTML element in the DOM (Document Object Model) and then apply 
a variety of attributes to that element to change the way it is displayed on the page.

In this section, you'll see how adding CSS styles to the elements of your CatPhotoApp can change it from simple text to something more.

-->

<!--
Basic CSS: Change the Color of Text
Now let's change the color of some of our text.

We can do this by changing the style of your h2 element.

The property that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the color style property.

Here's how you would set your h2 element's text color to blue:

<h2 style="color: blue;">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Note that it is a good practice to end inline style declarations with a ; .

-->

<!--
Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements

With CSS, there are hundreds of CSS properties that you can use to change the way an element looks on your page.

When you entered <h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>, you were styling that individual h2 element with inline CSS,
 which stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

That's one way to specify the style of an element, but there's a better way to apply CSS.

At the top of your code, create a style block like this:

<style>
</style>

Inside that style block, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements. For example, 
if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, you would add a style rule that looks like this:

<style>
  h2 {
    color: red;
  }
</style>

Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces ({ and }) around each element's style rule(s). 
You also need to make sure that your element's style definition is between the opening and closing style tags. 
Finally, be sure to add a semicolon to the end of each of your element's style rules.

-->


<!--
Use a CSS Class to Style an Element
Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.

Here's an example CSS class declaration:

<style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>

You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag. 
You can apply a class to an HTML element like this: <h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2> 
Note that in your CSS style element, class names start with a period. In your HTML elements' class attribute, 
the class name does not include the period.
-->

<!--
Change the Font Size of an Element

Font size is controlled by the font-size CSS property, like this:

h1 {
  font-size: 30px;
}
-->

<!--
Set the Font Family of an Element
You can set which font an element should use, by using the font-family property.

For example, if you wanted to set your h2 element's font to sans-serif, you would use the following CSS:

h2 {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
-->

<!--
Import a Google Font
we can also specify non-standard, custom web fonts for use on our website
To import a Google Font, you can copy the font(s) URL from the Google Fonts library and then paste it in your HTML

e.g : font Lobster link: <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

Now you can use the Lobster font in your CSS by using Lobster as the FAMILY_NAME as in the following example:
font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;

The GENERIC_NAME is optional, and is a fallback font in case the other specified font is not available.

-->

<!--
Specify How Fonts Should Degrade
There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers.
These generic font families include monospace, serif and sans-serif

p {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
}

sans-serif would be the defaul font in case helvetica fails

-->

<!--
Size Your Images
CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. 
Just like with fonts, we'll use px (pixels) to specify the image's width.

<style>
  .larger-image {
    width: 500px;
  }
</style>

-->

<!--
Add Borders Around Your Elements
CSS borders have properties like style, color and width.

For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class:

<style>
  .thin-red-border {
    border-color: red;
    border-width: 5px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style>

-->

<!--
Add Rounded Corners with border-radius
You can specify a border-radius with pixels. Give your cat photo a border-radius of 10px.

In addition to pixels, you can also specify the border-radius using a percentage.
-->

<!--
Give a Background Color to a div Element
You can set an element's background color with the background-color property.

For example, if you wanted an element's background color to be green, you'd put this within your style element:

.green-background {
  background-color: green;
}
-->


<!--
Set the id of an Element

In addition to classes, each HTML element can also have an id attribute.

There are several benefits to using id attributes: You can use an id to style a single element and later you'll learn 
that you can use them to select and modify specific elements with JavaScript.

id attributes should be unique. Browsers won't enforce this, but it is a widely agreed upon best practice.
So please don't give more than one element the same id attribute.

Here's an example of how you give your h2 element the id of cat-photo-app:

<h2 id="cat-photo-app">

-->

<!--
Use an id Attribute to Style an Element

One cool thing about id attributes is that, like classes, you can style them using CSS.

However, an id is not reusable and should only be applied to one element. 
An id also has a higher specificity (importance) than a class so if both are applied to the same element and have conflicting styles, 
the styles of the id will be applied.

Here's an example of how you can take your element with the id attribute of cat-photo-element and give it the background color of green.
In your style element:

#cat-photo-element {
  background-color: green;
}

Note that inside your style element, you always reference classes by putting a . in front of their names. 
You always reference ids by putting a # in front of their names.
-->


<!--
Adjust the Padding of an Element
You may have already noticed this, but all HTML elements are essentially little rectangles.
Three important properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element: padding, margin, and border.
An element's padding controls the amount of space between the element's content and its border.

<style>
  .injected-text {
    margin-bottom: -25px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .box {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: black;
    border-width: 5px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .yellow-box {
    background-color: yellow;
    padding: 10px;
  }

  .red-box {
    background-color: crimson;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
  }

  .blue-box {
    background-color: blue;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
  }
</style>
<h5 class="injected-text">margin</h5>

<div class="box yellow-box">
  <h5 class="box red-box">padding</h5>
  <h5 class="box blue-box">padding</h5>
</div>
-->

<!--
Adjust the Margin of an Element
An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.
-->


<!--
Add a Negative Margin to an Element
An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.

If you set an element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow larger.
-->

<!--
Add Different Padding to Each Side of an Element
Sometimes you will want to customize an element so that it has different amounts of padding on each of its sides.

CSS allows you to control the padding of all four individual sides of an element with the padding-top, padding-right, 
padding-bottom, and padding-left properties.
-->


<!--
Add Different Margins to Each Side of an Element
Sometimes you will want to customize an element so that it has a different margin on each of its sides.

CSS allows you to control the margin of all four individual sides of an element with the 
margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left properties.
-->

<!--
Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Padding of an Element
Instead of specifying an element's padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties individually, 
you can specify them all in one line, like this:

padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;

These four values work like a clock: top, right, bottom, left, and will produce the exact same result as using 
the side-specific padding instructions.
-->

<!--
Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Margin of an Element
margin: 10px 20px 10px 20px;
-->

<!--
Use Attribute Selectors to Style Elements
You have been adding id or class attributes to elements that you wish to specifically style. 
These are known as ID and class selectors. There are other CSS Selectors you can use to select custom groups of elements to style.

For this challenge, you will use the [attr=value] attribute selector to style the checkboxes in CatPhotoApp. This selector matches and styles 
elements with a specific attribute value. For example, the below code changes the margins of all elements with the attribute type and a corresponding value of radio:

[type='radio'] {
  margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;
}
-->

<!--
Understand Absolute versus Relative Units
In addition to px (number of pixels), CSS has a number of different length unit options that you can use.
The two main types of length units are absolute and relative. 
Absolute units tie to physical units of length. For example, in and mm refer to inches and millimeters, respectively. 
Absolute length units approximate the actual measurement on a screen, but there are some differences depending on a screen's resolution.

Relative units, such as em or rem, are relative to another length value. 
For example, em is based on the size of an element's font. 
If you use it to set the font-size property itself, it's relative to the parent's font-size.
-->

<!--
Every HTML page has a body element.

We can prove that the body element exists here by giving it a background-color of black.

We can do this by adding the following to our style element:

body {
  background-color: black;
}
-->

<!--
Inherit Styles from the Body Element

Now we've proven that every HTML page has a body element, and that its body element can also be styled with CSS.

Remember, you can style your body element just like any other HTML element, 
and all your other elements will inherit your body element's styles.
-->

<!--
Prioritize One Style Over Another

Sometimes your HTML elements will receive multiple styles that conflict with one another.

For example, your h1 element can't be both green and pink at the same time.

Let's see what happens when we create a class that makes text pink, then apply it to an element. 
Will our class override the body element's color: green; CSS property? A: Yes it does
-->

<!--
Override Styles in Subsequent CSS

Applying multiple class attributes to a HTML element is done with a space between them like this:

class="class1 class2"

Note: It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element.

However, the order of the class declarations in the <style> section is what is important. 
The second declaration will always take precedence over the first. Because .blue-text is declared second, it overrides the attributes of .pink-text
-->

<!--
Override Class Declarations by Styling ID Attributes

Note: It doesn't matter whether you declare this CSS above or below pink-text class, since id attribute will always take precedence.

-->

<!--
Override Class Declarations with Inline Styles
There are other ways that you can override CSS. Do you remember inline styles?
Remember, in line styles look like this:

<h1 style="color: green;">
-->

<!--
Override All Other Styles by using Important
But wait. There's one last way to override CSS. This is the most powerful method of all. 
But before we do it, let's talk about why you would ever want to override CSS.

In many situations, you will use CSS libraries. These may accidentally override your own CSS. 
So when you absolutely need to be sure that an element has specific CSS, you can use !important

An example of how to do this is:

color: red !important;

-->

<!--
Use Hex Code for Specific Colors

In CSS, we can use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components. 
For example, #000000 is black and is also the lowest possible value. You can find more information about the RGB color system here.
-->

<!--
Use Hex Code to Mix Colors
Color	Hex Code
Dodger Blue	#1E90FF
Green	#00FF00
Orange	#FFA500
Red	#FF0000
-->




<!--
Use Abbreviated Hex Code

Many people feel overwhelmed by the possibilities of more than 16 million colors. And it's difficult to remember hex code. 
Fortunately, you can shorten it.

For example, red's hex code #FF0000 can be shortened to #F00. 
This shortened form gives one digit for red, one digit for green, 
and one digit for blue.

Color	Short Hex Code
Cyan	#0FF
Green	#0F0
Red	#F00
Fuchsia	#F0F
-->

<!--
Use RGB values to Color Elements

nother way you can represent colors in CSS is by using RGB values.

The RGB value for black looks like this:

rgb(0, 0, 0)

-->

<!--
Use CSS Variables to change several elements at oncePassed
CSS Variables are a powerful way to change many CSS style properties at once by changing only one value.
-->

<!--
Create a custom CSS Variable

To create a CSS variable, you just need to give it a name with two hyphens in front of it and assign it a value like this:
--penguin-skin: gray;

-->

<!--
Use a custom CSS Variable
After you create your variable, you can assign its value to other CSS properties by referencing the name you gave it.

background: var(--penguin-skin);

-->

<!--
Attach a Fallback value to a CSS Variable

When using your variable as a CSS property value, 
you can attach a fallback value that your browser will revert to if the given variable is invalid.

Note: This fallback is not used to increase browser compatibility, and it will not work on IE browsers. 
Rather, it is used so that the browser has a color to display if it cannot find your variable.

Here's how you do it:

background: var(--penguin-skin, black);

-->
-->

<!--
Improve Compatibility with Browser Fallbacks
When working with CSS you will likely run into browser compatibility issues at some point. This is why it's important to provide browser fallbacks to avoid potential proble
If you do want to provide a browser fallback, it's as easy as providing another more widely supported value immediately before your declaration. That way an older browser will have something to fall back on, while a newer browser will just interpret whatever declaration comes later in the cascade.
-->

<!--
Inherit CSS Variables

When you create a variable, it is available for you to use inside the selector in which you create it. 
It also is available in any of that selector's descendants. This happens because CSS variables are inherited, just like ordinary properties.

To make use of inheritance, CSS variables are often defined in the :root element.
:root is a pseudo-class selector that matches the root element of the document, usually the html element. 
By creating your variables in :root, they will be available globally and can be accessed from any other selector in the style sheet.

-->

<!--
Change a variable for a specific area
When you create your variables in :root they will set the value of that variable for the whole page.
You can then over-write these variables by setting them again within a specific element.

-->

<!--
Use a media query to change a variable

CSS Variables can simplify the way you use media queries.
For instance, when your screen is smaller or larger than your media query break point, you can change the value of a variable, 
and it will apply its style wherever it is used.
